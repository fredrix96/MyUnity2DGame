INFORMATION:

The goal is to kill as many enemies as you can before dying.

The enemies grow larger and stronger the longer you let them stay alive and will grow faster
the more enemies you kill.

Ducking makes you invisible for the targets and you can not be hit by their projectiles.
However, if they come too close, they will see you and start to kick you.

You will punch enemies if they are too close.

Your punch does more damage than your projectiles, and the enemies' kicks do less than
their projectiles.

You gain health when killing an ememy. The stronger an enemy is, the more health you get.

Good luck!
